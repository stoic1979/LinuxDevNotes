# LinuxDevNotes
My resuable notes for linux development - vimrc, commands notes, some common shell scripts that a linux developer may need to use across his/her various computes. Also, save me time esp. when I am working on a fresh linux install, save my time. Hope this may be useful to other developers too !!!
